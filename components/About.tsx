                My name is Nathaniel Jones and I am an industry-experienced,
                full-stack software developer with a passion for creating React
                applications. Iâ€™ve spent the last three years working primarily
                with Typescript, Javascript, React, and the NextJS frameworks,
                as an associate software engineer at The MITRE Corporation.

                My projects at MITRE were funded by the Center for Medicare and
                Medicaid Services (CMS) and included the creation of full-stack
                web applications and prototype servers to help define, test, and
                implement FHIR, a new medical data and quality reporting
                standard.

                I attended New York University for two years before transferring
                to the University of Massachusetts Honors College, where I
                majored in computer science and graduated with a 3.96 GPA. For
                my thesis project, I created a virtual pet IOS app, with
                ReactNative, that uses passive ad revenue to raise money for
                local dog shelters.

                Recently, I left MITRE to volunteer with exotic and endangered
                animals, and explore freelance software development. I&apos;ve
                been most interested in contributing to projects that are
                working to fight climate change and promote animal wellfare.
