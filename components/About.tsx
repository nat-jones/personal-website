              My name is Nathaniel Jones and I am an industry-experienced,
              full-stack software developer with a passion for creating React
              applications. Iâ€™ve spent the last three years working primarily
              with Typescript, Javascript, React, and the NextJS frameworks, as
              an associate software engineer at The MITRE Corporation.

              My projects at MITRE were funded by the Center for Medicare and
              Medicaid Services (CMS) and included the creation of full-stack
              web applications and prototype servers to help define, test, and
              implement FHIR, a new medical data and quality reporting standard.

              I attended New York University for two years before transferring
              to the University of Massachusetts Honors College, where I majored
              in computer science and graduated with a 3.96 GPA. For my thesis
              project, I created a virtual pet IOS app, with ReactNative, that
              uses passive ad revenue to raise money for local dog shelters.

              Recently, I left MITRE to volunteer with exotic and endangered
              animals, and explore freelance software development. I&apos;ve
              been most interested in contributing to projects that are working
              to fight climate change and promote animal wellfare.
